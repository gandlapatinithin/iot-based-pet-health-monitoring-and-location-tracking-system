# 🐾 iot-based-pet-health-monitoring-and-location-tracking-system

A smart IoT-based solution for real-time tracking and monitoring of pets using Arduino, GSM, GPS, DS18B20 temperature sensor, heartbeat sensor, and an LCD display.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📍 **Live Location Tracking** – Uses GPS to acquire real-time pet location.
- 🛁 **SMS Notifications** – Sends location data to the owner's phone using a GSM module.
- 🌡️ **Temperature Monitoring** – Tracks ambient temperature with DS18B20.
- ❤️ **Heartbeat Monitoring** – Uses a heartbeat sensor to monitor the pet's heart rate.
- 🖥️ **LCD Display** – Shows live data and system status.
- 🔧 **Modular Design** – Easy to upgrade and expand with additional features.
